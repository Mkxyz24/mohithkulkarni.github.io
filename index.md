## Bio

I am an Associate Support Engineer at [MathWorks India](https://www.mathworks.com/), where I work in the wireless communications modelling team.
<!-- am jointly advised by  [Prof. C. V. Jawahar](http://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/) and [Prof. Vinay P. Namboodiri](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/vinaypn/) at [Center for Visual Information Technology](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/). My research is focused on neural machine translation for low resource languages using low compute resources. -->

Prior to this, I have spent a brief time as an intern at [IMI Mobile](https://imimobile.com) in Hyderabad working on customer churn prediction using supervised machine learning models.
<!-- problem of dynamic analysis of benign programs, under the supervision of [Dr. Sai Praveen Kadiyala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kadiyala-sai-praveen-92131733/).  -->
